  o Minor bugfixes (KIST):
    - Prevent KISTSchedRunInterval from having values of 0 or 1, neither of
      which work properly. Additionally, make a separate KISTSchedRunIntervalClient
      parameter, so that the client and relay KIST values can be set separately.
      Set the default of both to 2ms. Fixes bug 40808; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
