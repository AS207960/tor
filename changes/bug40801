  o Minor bugfixes (conflux):
    - Fix stream attachment order when creating conflux circuits, so that
      stream attachment happens after finishing the full link handshake,
      rather than upon set finalization. Fixes bug 40801; bugfix on
      0.4.8.1-alpha.
    - Remove a "BUG" warning from conflux_pick_first_leg that can be
      triggered by broken or malicious clients. Fixes bug 40801; bugfix
      on 0.4.8.1-alpha.
    - Fix a case where we were resuming reading on edge connections that
      were already marked for close. Fixes bug 40801; bugfix on 0.4.8.1-alpha.
