  o Minor bugfixes (conflux):
    - Count leg launch attempts prior to attempting to launch them. This
      avoids inifinite launch attempts due to internal circuit building
      failures. Additionally, double-check that we have enough exits in
      our consensus overall, before attempting to launch conflux sets.
      Fixes bug 40811; bugfix on 0.4.8.1-alpha.
